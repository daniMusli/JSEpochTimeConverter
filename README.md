# JSEpochTimeConverter
A simple website to do Epoch time conversion operations 
the code was written based on an assignment which doesnt allow us to use Date library functions that is why i used simple 
maths operations to recreate the functionality of these methods 
this project was done using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and Vanilla JavaScript
